Similar to Caesar Cipher


There will be 4 shift values: A, B, C, D
keys = 5 digits, can start with zero
  EX 02715

  A = 02
  B = 27
  C = 71
  D = 15

Offset will be date: 4/8/95

DDMMYY

040895

040895 ^ 2 = 1672401025
a 1
b 0
c 2
d 5

Then add first shifts to date shifts


Total offset =
A 3
B 27
C 73
D 20


If there is a special character, like a comma, it is not encrypted, but it does take up a number...

"HELLO WORLD"
 12341234123


 "HELLO, WORLD"
  123412341234

You need to build an enigma class, but you'll probably need more than just that class.


Make sure there is a command line interface.
